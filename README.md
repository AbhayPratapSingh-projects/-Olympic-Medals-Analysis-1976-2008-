🏅 Olympic Medals Analysis (1976–2008)
A Python & Power BI–Driven Historical Exploration of Medal Trends.
This project analyzes Olympic medal data from 1976 to 2008 to uncover how nations, sports, disciplines, genders, and athletes have contributed to the evolution of Olympic success. The analysis is written and executed entirely in PyCharm, using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, while final visual storytelling is presented through a Power BI visualization deck (PPT).

🎯 Project Objectives
🥇 1. Medal Distribution Across Countries & Years (1976–2008)
Identify patterns of dominance among countries.
Compare how medal counts shift across different Olympic years.

👨‍🦰👩‍🦱 2. Gender-Based Medal Distribution
Study the rise of female participation.
Compare performance differences between male and female athletes over decades.

🌍 3. Top 20 Country Performance Analysis 
Based on:-
Total medals
Gold / Silver / Bronze
Sports categories
Discipline-level performances

🏆 4. Top-Performing Athletes & Countries
Identify athletes with the highest medal wins.
Analyze factors contributing to their dominance (sport, discipline, era).

🥇 5. Highest Medal-Winning Sports & Disciplines
Determine which disciplines generate the most medals.
Study how popularity and performance trends shift from 1976 to 2008.

📅 6. Year-wise Medal-Leading Disciplines (1976–2008)
Identify the leading disciplines for each Olympic year.
Discover sports that consistently dominate across decades.

📊 7. Visualizations for Data Storytelling
Visuals created using:
Matplotlib (Bar, Line, Pie Charts)
Seaborn (Heatmaps, Scatterplots, Trend Lines)
Power BI (Final storytelling & PPT deck)
